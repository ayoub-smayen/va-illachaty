```

Install StreamChat

```shell
# using npm
npm install stream-chat axios javascript-time-ago

# using yarn
yarn add stream-chat axios javascript-time-ago
 
```

If you make any change to the javascript files you should use browserify to bundle it.

Browerify is a dev dependency we are using it to bundle our node packages --- stream, Axios, timeago to be used on the frontend.

```shell 

npm install browserify

browserify main.js -o bundle.js

browserify ./src/Login/index.js -o login.bundle.js
```

You can now run the `index.html` file in your public directory with any [live server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) or anything else.
